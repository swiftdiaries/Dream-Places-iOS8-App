# Dream-Places-iOS8-App
#### Double-View app that uses the MapKit and CoreLocations framework. 
A long press (gestureRecognizer) on the Map View adds the Location data to the Table View. The ```subthoroughfare, thoroughfare``` strings contain the reverse Geocoded data from the chosen location. The TableView contains these strings which give the address of the location. The date on which the location is added is also recorded in TableView using the ```NSDate()``` function.
